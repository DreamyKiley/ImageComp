# ImageComp
ImageComp is a simple and user-friendly Python application designed for compressing images with near-lossless quality and converting WebP. This application supports JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats, allowing you to efficiently reduce image file sizes while maintaining high image quality. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, making it accessible for users of all experience levels.

Key Features:
*   Compress JPEG and PNG
*   It doubles as a WebP converter (This does not compress as WebP is technically more compressed than jpeg)
*   Near-lossless compression for high-quality image preservation

# Installation
